# Social Media App

You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and Tailwind. Follow @Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing. 

Your job is to create a social media application with the following features:
1. User authentication using Firebase Auth
2. Tab navigation to different routes: Home, Profile, and Create Post
3. User profiles with customizable information
4. Ability to create posts with text and images
5. A home feed to display posts from all users
6. Like and comment functionality for posts

Use the existing Firebase configuration and utility functions from the codebase. Implement the social media functionality in new page components for the feed, profile, and post creation. Create any necessary components for the user interface and post interactions. Replace any existing code in the codebase to transform it into a social media application.
